**You're all set!**

You must leave the extension tab open for the bot to perform a checkout during a restock.

If your feed is not scrolling at all times, please reopen the extension.

For any questions or issues, please leave a message in the [GPU Drops Discord](https://discord.gg/gpudrops) in the #tech-support channel, and we will get back to you within a few hours.

**IMPORTANT**

For virgin accounts that have not purchased any B-stock in the past, you must "break-in" your account by performing a mock B-stock checkout until you arrive at https://secure.evga.com/Cart/Checkout_PlaceOrder.aspx


## Tips & Tricks

**We strongly suggest using PayPal as your payment method for EVGA**. If you use a debit/credit card, EVGA may ask for 2FA, randomly decline your card, or you may run into cookie bans (error code webpages).

If you are using PayPal for payment, [setup PayPal One Touch](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/one-touch-checkout).
